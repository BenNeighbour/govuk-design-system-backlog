# How you can contribute

The GOV.UK Design System is currently in beta. The Design System team will be developing these contribution guidelines based on user research over the coming months.

## Discussing styles, components and patterns

You can discuss the existing styles, components and patterns in the Design System, or ones being developed, by commenting on issues in the [community backlog](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/projects/1). Alternatively, you can email govuk-design-system-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk. 

For example, you can:

- ask questions about a style, component or pattern
- answer questions from other contributors
- share examples or demos of a component or pattern
- share research relating to a style, component or pattern


## Proposing new components or patterns

If you have an idea for a new component or pattern you can propose it by [raising an issue](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/new) in the backlog or emailing the Design System team.
 

## Developing components and patterns

If there’s something you’d be interested in working on, comment on its issue in the [community backlog](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/projects/1) or email the Design System team.

## Design System criteria

To help ensure that the contents of the GOV.UK Design System are of a high quality and meet user needs, all new proposals, components and patterns must meet the [Design System criteria](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/blob/master/docs/CRITERIA.md).
