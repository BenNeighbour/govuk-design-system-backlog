# Contribution guidelines

The GOV.UK Design System is currently in private beta. We will be developing these contribution guidelines based on user research over the next 12 weeks.

## Discussing styles, components and patterns

You can discuss the work being developed here by commenting on issues via the [issues list](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues) or [backlog](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/projects/1).

For example, you can:

- ask questions about a component or pattern
- answer questions from other contributors
- share examples or demos of a component or pattern
- share research relating to a component or pattern

## Proposing new styles, components or patterns

If you have an idea for a new style, component or pattern you can propose it by [raising an issue](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/new).

During private beta we will be exploring ways of reviewing new issues against the [Design System criteria](CRITERIA.md).
