The Design System Working Group is a multi-disciplinary, cross-government group who's purpose is to ensure that GOV.UK Design System continues to meet the needs of it's users and that any styles, components and patterns published in the Design System meet the Design System standard.

They do this by:

- developing the [Design System criteria](CRITERIA.md)
- reviewing new proposals against those criteria
- approving new styles, components and patterns
- resolving queries escalated to them by the Design System team
- representing the needs of users from their department

The members of the working group are nominated by the departmental Heads of Design.
