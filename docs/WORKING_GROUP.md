The Design System Working Group is a multi-disciplinary, cross-government group whose purpose is to ensure that any styles, components and patterns published in the GOV.UK Design System are of a high quality and meet user needs.

They do this by:

- developing the [Design System criteria](CRITERIA.md)
- reviewing new proposals against the criteria
- approving new styles, components and patterns for publication
- resolving queries escalated to them by the GOV.UK Design System team
- representing the needs of users from their department

The members of the working group are nominated by each department's Head of Design.
