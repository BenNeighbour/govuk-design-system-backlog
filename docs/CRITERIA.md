# Design System criteria

<br>

## New proposals

To be considered for inclusion in the GOV.UK Design System, components and patterns must be:

| Criteria | Description |
| :------- | :---------- |
| Useful   | It addresses a user need that’s shared by multiple services or products. |
| Unique   | It doesn’t duplicate something which already exists in the GOV.UK Design System, unless it’s intended to replace it. |

The [working group](WORKING_GROUP.md) will review all proposals in the [backlog](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/projects/1) to check they meet these criteria, before they are agreed.
