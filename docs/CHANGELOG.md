# GOV.UK Design System Backlog Changelog

This file documents any significant changes we make to the way we organise and run this backlog.

It is not a record of all the changes made to the contents of the backlog.


# How we started

One of our goals is to create a GOV.UK Design System which represents the needs of cross government teams. The process of building a backlog should be co-created by people in different departments to reflect those needs. So to start with something that could help facilitate those conversations we created a master list of components and patterns which live in Service Manual, Elements, GOV.UK and in other departmental pattern libraries: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HlywOGUPuAOzeI2aeevHGNOOiO1dH5LF_HB1VrmT2sY/edit#gid=1882864638

We have been talking to representatives of different departments, both designers and developers to get their feedback on what we have on the Design System backlog, identifying what is missing, and spotting where there is overlap in work in different departments.

Current user pain points from our research:
- Lack of awareness of the available design resources
- Teams developing new things when someone´s already solved the problem
- Duplication of effort and inconsistently designed services
- Useful patterns and components are missing
- A lack of clarity regarding the official status of some patterns
- Design resources feels like they're owned by GDS

The idea was that this place could host and help raise visibility on what people are working on, while something in not available in the GOV.UK Design System. We want to encourage collaboration and avoid duplication by making work visible to others

## Cross- Government Design System workshop

On 11 December 2017, 18 designers from across government (HO, MOJ, DWP, DVLA, HMRC, Land Registry, Environment Agency) took part in a workshop to:

* agree a list of components and patterns that are needed in government 
* generate ideas for cross-gov collaboration and contribution 
* review 2 new components to decide if they should be added to the GOV.UK Design System

See the results and iteration to the Standard and the backlog from the workshop here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15kcx5cBw_PzYW7mmnTbYL5XilmG0yrvhCzA-1M_O4TE/edit#slide=id.g2fafd40fca_0_0
